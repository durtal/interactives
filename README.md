Interactive Experiments
=======================

This repo will contain various interactive visualisation projects I start, attempt, bludgeon, butcher, complete?, etc.

The primary Javascript libraries I use are [D3js](http://d3js.org/) and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), though I will hopefully explore alternatives.  The primary libraries are included in the `bower.json`, but further dependencies might be required in each subfolder.  I'll also attempt to list tutorials, posts, exampls that I found useful/inspiring when attempting any of these projects.

### Explorable Explanations

I have been inspired by a series of visualisations by [Victor Powell](https://twitter.com/vicapow) and [Lewis Lehe](https://twitter.com/LewisLehe).  Their posts typically use AngularJS and D3, and can usually be found at [setosa](http://setosa.io/ev/) (examples include [Conditional Probability](http://setosa.io/ev/conditional-probability/) and [Principal Component Analysis](http://setosa.io/ev/principal-component-analysis/)).  Victor and Lewis cite a post entitled [Explorable Explanations](http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations) by [Bret Victor](https://twitter.com/worrydream).  Maarten Lambrechts shared an interesting [post](http://www.maartenlambrechts.be/the-rise-of-explorable-explanations) which covers Bret Victor's essay but includes great links to some examples of Explorable Explanations.   One such link was to [Mike Bostock's](https://twitter.com/mbostock) (author of D3) [Visualising Algorithms](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms), which is mind blowing!
