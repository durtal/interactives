Derby Sectionals Visualisation
==============================

An attempt to create an interactive visualisation/explanation/analysis of the 2015 Derby.

### About

This visualisation displays the sectionals of runners in the 2015 Derby.  It uses AngularJS and D3 to create and manage the various interactive elements.  I also used R to get data for the elevation profile of the Derby course.
